## Contribution Guidelines

Bug reports and feature requests are always appriciated, but please keep these things in mind:

- Make sure that a similar issue hasn't already been raised
- When submitting bugs, please include detailed steps on how to reproduce

If you'd like to contribute with code or documentation, please follow these simple steps.

- Select an unassigned issue labeled 'help-wanted'
- If you want to submit new code without an associated issue, submit an issue first. Nothing is worse than doing work that isn't accepted
- Comment on the issue that you are working on it
- Fork this repo (if you haven't already) and do all your work in a new branch
- Submit your work as a pull request
